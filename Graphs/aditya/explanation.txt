bfs
1. make a visited hashset, queue with start node
2. while loop until we have queue
3. we popleft from queue and run another loop for all the neighbours in that node
4. then we check if the neighbour is in visited or not
5. if not add them to visited and to the queue

This is level order traversal


dfs:
1. we do recursive approach
2. we have a visited hasset and curr node
3. if curr node is in visited then we return 
4. else we print them and add it to visited
5. then we run a loop for all the neighbour of the node, and do recursion
